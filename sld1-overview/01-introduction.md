# What is Sample Code Library?
Sample Code Library (SCL) is an umbrella term that includes the different promotion and enablement HW drivers, virtual applications or reference designs.  Strong emphases is put on a building block concept, where these can be combined and people can experiment even more complex applications reusing these sample codes. The aim is to extend the operation to 3rd party HW platforms / ecosystems as well, not just supporting our development kits.



# Sample Code Library

## Mission
We are to provide an extensive and well-maintained building block library, enabling direct collaboration between internal and external participants and driving an active Silicon Labs mass market development ecosystem.

## Vision
As the go-to provider for IoT solutions, we provide developers at all levels with an easy to use, accessible sample code library they can use to speed their developments and get to market faster.

## Strategy
Focus on ease of use and maintenance for mass market customers to reduce customization and support requests
Create the process so that distributors and 3P contributors can easily engage
Develop easy to use, reusable, and scalable sample code portfolio
Build a significant library of reusable building blocks: simple sample code, hardware drivers
Build a set of virtual applications and tangible reference designs using these building blocks
Build a collaborative community and ecosystem based on Silicon Labs and 3P hardware
