# Repositories

The hardware drivers and application examples are stored on [Github](https://github.com/SiliconLabs) in public Git repositories.

## Hardware Drivers
These are drivers for third-party devices such as sensors, displays, and interfaces for various types of hardware.

> Deprecated repository, the newly developed drivers for the application examples are stored in the Third-Party Hardware Drivers GSDK Extension.
