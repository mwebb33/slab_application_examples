# Usage
This section contains information on adding the Third-Party Hardware Drivers GSDK Extension and importing Application Example projects into Simplicity Studio.

## Importing Simplicity Studio projects
Simplicity Studio projects are typically stored under the SimplicityStudio folder inside each project's folder in the Git repositories.

### File Formats

* ***.sls**

  Legacy projects provide *.sls files. These Simplicity Studio files contain each source file required to build the project (except GSDK files).

* ***.slcp**
  
  Newer projects provide only *.slcp files; these files contain the project configuration, such as the configured software components, source files, headers, includes paths, etc.

* ***.btconf**

    This file contains configuration interpreted by the Bluetooth GATT Configurator Tool, and it contains the GATT database with the configured services and characteristics.
* ***.pintool**

    The configuration files used by the Pin Tool, these files contain hardware pin assignments and mode configurations.

### Importing *.sls projects

* **STEP 1** **[File] -> [Import]**

  ![Import](doc/studio/import.png)

* **STEP 2** Select a folder containing *.sls file(s). Select a project from the detected projects list and click on **Next**.

  ![Import](doc/studio/import-finish.png)

* **STEP 4** Type a name to the new project or keep the original naming. Click on **Finish**.

The selected Simplicity Studio project is imported into your workspace. You can compile the project and run the executable on a real hardware like a development kit.

## Adding SDK Extensions for Hardware Drivers

You can find the Third-Party Hardware Drivers GSDK Extension on Github; as a first step you should clone the repository to your local computer.


You can follow this step-by-step guide to install and use the extension or watch a guideline video showing the same steps.

* **STEP 1** Clone Third-Party Hardware Drivers repository from Github

  It is up to you to choose a folder on your computer to clone the repository into.

  > git clone https://github.com/SiliconLabs/platform_hardware_drivers_sdk_extensions.git


* **STEP 2** Open Simplicity Studio and go to Window/Preferences

  ![Preferences](doc/studio/sdke/preferences.png)

* **STEP 3** Go to Simplicity Studio/SDKs, select an installed GSDK (version >=4.2.0), and click on **Add Extension**

  ![AddSDKExtension](doc/studio/sdke/sdks.png)

* **STEP 4** Select the SDK Extension's location, click on **OK**

  The SDK Extension will be detected in the repository folder.

  ![SelectExtension](doc/studio/sdke/add-extension.png)

* **STEP 5** Click on the **Trust** button on the Verify SDK Extension dialog

  ![TrustSDKExtension](doc/studio/sdke/sdke-trust.png)

* **STEP 6** The SDK Extension successfully installed, click on **Apply and Close**

  ![Installed](doc/studio/sdke/installed.png)

### Example Project Templates

The Third-Party Hardware Drivers extension provides example project templates for each supported driver.

* **STEP 1** Open the Launcher perspective in Simplicity Studio

  ![LauncherPerspective](doc/studio/sdke/launcher.png)

* **STEP 2** Select a product either in the My Products or in the Debug Adapters dialog

* **STEP 3** Filter examples by typing "third" or "Third Party" in the "filter on keywords" input 
* **STEP 4** Select an example project from the resources and click on the **Create** button.

  ![LauncherCreateProject](doc/studio/sdke/launcher-examples.png)

* **STEP 5** Follow the steps in the New Project Wizard dialog. 

The Launcher creates a new project based on the selected template, and this project contains basic example on how your application can integrate a driver using the extension.


### Software Components

* **STEP 1** Open a project configuration (the selected perspective should be "Simplicity IDE").

* **STEP 2** Select **SOFTWARE COMPONENTS** and search for the keyword "third" in the Search keywords, component's name input

  > Ensure that the components with **Evaluation** quality level are enabled in the Software Components view.

  ![SoftwareComponents](doc/studio/sdke/sw-components.png)


* **STEP 3** Select a driver from the list by clicking on it, click on the **Install**

  ![SoftwareComponentsInstall](doc/studio/sdke/sw-components-installed.png)

The selected hardware driver is installed in your project. The installed driver's API can be found in the extension's public folder.

  ![PublicAPI](doc/studio/sdke/driver-api.png)

Public header files should be included in your application for each installed driver.

For further information on how to use drivers in your project, see [application example templates](#example-project-templates) in the Launcher.
